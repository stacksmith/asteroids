asteroids
=========

Forked from ASTeroids by github user andyhd.  See README.old and the repo.
Thank you andyhd!

Clean-up
--------

Code has been re-organized and cleaned up.  Some names have been altered
to make it more sensible (i.e. vector renamed xy-off, since it was neither
a math vector nor a lisp vector...)  AST pun removed as too annoying.

The game is also visually upgraded - the ship and the rocks are being 
adjusted to look better.  The game is now keyboard controlled (the mouse 
was not for me).

TODO:
-----

* allow remapping of keys
* fix the main-loop jumble, move logic into world
* separate attract screen
* fix pause
